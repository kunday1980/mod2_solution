      <section><p> Root Canal Treatment is the treatment of the canal within the tooth which contains the tissues and nerve. The infection is caused by bacteria that has entered the tooth through cavities, broken fillings or due to trauma (injury to the tooth). The tooth has a crown (which is the part of tooth that is visible outside) and root (which anchors the tooth within the bone). The crown has an outer protective layer know as enamel which is hard compared to the outer layer on the root, the cementum. The next layer beneath the enamel and cementum is the more softer dentine layer. The innermost space within the dentine is called the pulp and this extends from the crown to the root. The root canal treatment involves cleaning the pulp space followed by filling with inert material to prevent from reinfection. Some teeth have more than one root and hence more than one canal. To ensure success, all the canals in a tooth have to be treated.</p></section>

   <div class="title">Advantages</div>
      <section><p>Root canal treatment maybe the only option available to save the tooth when the infection has spread into the pulp tissue. It relieves pain, discomfort and sweling caused by the infection. The other alternative to root canal treatment is to extract (or loose) the tooth which could affect the functionality of the teeth and the appearance. It helps preserving the bone around the tooth which deteriotes once the tooth is extracted. </p></section>

   <div class="title">Risks </div>
      <section><p>Root canal treatment is not alway 100% succesful. The success rates depend on whether the infection is limited within the tooth or if it has spread beyond the root end into the surrounding tissue. It also depends teh remaining tooth structure, position of the tooth within the dental arch and the amount of bone supporting the tooth. The treating dentist should be able to give you an overview of the prognosis of the treatment. The risks can include separation of the instrument within the canal during treatment, perforation (when the instrument follows a different path rather than the path of the canal) and rarely damage to the nerve or sinus. The dentist will advise you of the potential risks involved in treating a particular tooth.</p></section>
